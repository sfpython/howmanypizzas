# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a "howmanypizzas" calculator project designed to determine how many pizzas to order for meetups. The project is currently in its initial setup phase with only basic repository files.

## Repository Status

This repository is in early development with minimal code structure:
- Contains only LICENSE (MIT) and README.md files
- No package.json, build scripts, or source code yet
- No testing framework configured
- No dependencies defined

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, development commands will need to be established as the project grows. Common patterns for similar projects typically include:

- Build: `npm run build` (once package.json is added)
- Test: `npm test` (once testing is configured)
- Development server: `npm run dev` or `npm start`
- Linting: `npm run lint` (once linting tools are added)

## Project Architecture

The project structure is minimal and will need to be established. Typical structure for a pizza calculator might include:
- Core calculation logic for determining pizza quantities
- User interface components (web or CLI)
- Configuration for different meetup sizes and pizza preferences
- Data models for pizza types, sizes, and serving calculations

## Next Steps

This project appears to be in the initial planning phase. Future development will likely require:
1. Choosing a technology stack (Node.js, Python, web-based, etc.)
2. Setting up package management and dependencies
3. Implementing core pizza calculation algorithms
4. Adding user interface
5. Setting up testing and build processes
